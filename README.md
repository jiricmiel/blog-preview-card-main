## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

On this project I've tried to put semantic HTML to live.
I learned how to work with variable and static fonts and also how to use @font-face.
I deepened my knowledge on SASS partials and their propper implementation using @forward and @use.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```
@font-face {
  font-family: "Figtree";
  font-style: normal;
  font-weight: 100 900;
  src: url(../assets/fonts/Figtree-VariableFont_wght.ttf)
    format("truetype-variations");
}
```

### Continued development

In the future I'm ready to dig in JS for sure as I've already started the learning proces.
In regards of HTML & CSS I'm going to continue my learning and deepening of my knowledge as there is so much of it and it's only the begining.
I'll probably stick with using SASS (.scss).

### Useful resources

- [Chat GPT](https://chatgpt.com/) - Chat GPT was very usefull. It helped me with finding correct way of implementing SASS partials and using @font-face.
- [Kevin Powel](https://github.com/kevin-powell) - as always Kevin helps with everything.
- [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann) - same as Kevin. His courses helped me alot.
